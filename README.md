## OUR VISION

[![The Project's Idea](https://i.imgur.com/hopifYN.png)](https://youtu.be/dicqOVMA2oE)

The two challenges we deal with are pollution and small-scale investments. Egypt's streets are full of garbage that leads to numerous problems. Garbage management and recycling capacity are not enough to collect all of the garbage. Therefore, we have decided to mobilize new cheap recycling ideas to recycle garbage even cheaper than usual to make it possible for future large-scale plans for our project. We also help people with low financial standards to invest their small amounts of money for higher benefit than that of the banks through using our application. As we enable people to invest the amount of money they want, no matter how small or large it is, we raise our possibility to receive the investments of many Egyptians to help them and save our environment.

## Current Phase

We are working on reengineering this application and here is the web and mobile apps architecture design. I will redesign the app and wrote it from scratch again because I wrote and designed it previously in 2 months only, because we had have some competitions at this time. I know the code is a spaghetti code. So, I am going to rewrite it and implement clean code principles and with a clean architecture.
